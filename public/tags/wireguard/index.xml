      <description>Wireguard Quickstart Guide I know!

      <description>Wireguard AppIndicator At the time of writing, December of 2019, there exists no simple to use graphical interface for managing Wireguard connections as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. To resolve this issue, I wanted to make an AppIndicator with the following capabilities:
 View status of Wireguard interface Enable and disable Wireguard interface View and copy the IP address of the interface  I also wanted to be able to use this on both Gnome Shell systems and systems with only support for AppIndicators, so the script is able to be used as either a standalone script running in the background or as a Gnome Shell extension.</description>

      <description>Introduction Wireguard is a beautiful thing :sob:. But one thing that I have found to be a point of contention is the lack of a simple interface for managing an existing Wireguard server. From some light browsing, I have found a couple of solutions that are mainly geared towards enterprise use or paid services but no simple FOSS CLI alternatives. Therefore, I feel that it would be nice to have a simple Bash script or Python script to accomplish this task.</description>
