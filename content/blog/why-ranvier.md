My sophomore year of high school, I was taking AP Psychology on Florida Virtual
School (FLVS). We had a class in-person at my school where we could work on this
class during school hours. Yeah... Good luck keeping us from doing more
interesting things.

This was the perfect time for me to learn about TCP/IP networking, Linux, and
self-hosting awesomeness. Inspired by the class I was taking, I'd already named
my Minecraft server `myelin`, my homelab server `stem`, and my Digital Ocean
Droplet `axon`. I hadn't bought a domain before, but the time was coming, as
`myelin.ddns.net` just wasn't cutting it anymore.

On an occasion where I had actually decided to spend some time on the class, I
learned about the [nodes of
Ranvier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_of_Ranvier). This was an awesome
sounding name (thanks Louis-Antoine Ranvier!) and nobody had taken it yet! Bonus
points because the TLD was `.net`, which fits perfectly into the analogy of a
*net*work of neurons.
