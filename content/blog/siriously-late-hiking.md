It was a beautiful chewsday when, hard at work delivering shareholder value, I
received a text. Originally, I had planned to go do some stairmaster with Danny
later that day. However, this text from Richmond informed me that he had desires
to hike. But not just any hike - we were to ascend the legendary [Mount
Si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Si). Well... why do stairmaster when you
can do the real thing?!

We headed out after work and collected our hiking gear, along with some
delicious Bahn Mi sandwiches from Saigon Deli in U-District. Unfortunately, I am
notorious for taking my sweet ass time and by the time we had picked up
Priscilla and Richmond, we were already hitting the 8 o'clock mark. Yaouch!!
This was going to be a long night...

_Into the unknown..._

The hike up was actually quite nice. In other night hikes, I was accustomed to
finding other people either leaving the trail as they finished up their hikes.
However, this time was much more solitary, as there was scant a single soul at
the trailhead's parking lot. Throughout the night, the only souls on the trail
that night were us. This was nice!

_Getting snowy!_

To fight against morale (I'm not a huge fan of night hiking, though I've done it
a lot!), I was jamming the frick out to some sick EDM music with Danny. As we
approached the top of the trail, the wind started picking up and the snow came
out to say "ello!".

_The first mini-scramble! The stars were brilliant tonight_

The first class 2ish scramble you hit at the summit area on Si wasn't too bad!
There were pretty clear footsteps from people (and dogs, we hope..) that had
been there probably earlier that day. We ascended the slippery icy rocks to get
some epic pictures at the haystack and much on the rest of our food.

_A needle in the haystack; ah darn, that's just snow_

_Turn that damn light off!!_

The haystack area was __the worst__. If you can't tell, I am desperately trying
to stay warm with the use of my Frog Tog jacket as a hard shell for my pants.
Even two layers wasn't enough to stop the brisk probably 20-30 deg wind-chill.

The food and drink was delightful though.

_Wait... was this whole hike just a Whiteclaw Ad and I'm not the main character??_

_ArGh_

This was Richmond's second time to Si ever and in his prior excursion in
high-school, he didn't recall whether he made it to the haystack. We made sure
to create photographic evidence of his visit on this occasion:

The hike down was swift and much easier than the way up, especially as we
escaped the wind. I was hit with a spout of extreme sleepiness which persisted
all the way to the car seat and then my warm cozy bed..

Night hiking isn't my favorite. But it sure beats stairmaster!
