I'm moving up the foodchain! After lots of time invested in making my own Docker
images and making some for work as well, I have decided to take them more
seriously and give them a proper home
[here](https://github.com/ranvier-docker-images/). I have already uploaded a
couple of images (one for the BIND9 DNS server and another for various versions
of SpigotMC). I'm planning to upload more, including:

- OpenLDAP
- Kerberos
- Portable development environment
- Bastion server

Until then!
