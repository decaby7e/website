# Ranvier Docker Images

I'm moving up the foodchain! After lots of time invested in making my own Docker images and making some for work as well, I have decided to take them more seriously and give them a proper home [here](https://github.com/ranvier-docker-images/). I have already uploaded a couple of images (one for the BIND9 DNS server and another for various versions of SpigotMC). I'm planning to upload more, including:

- OpenLDAP
- Kerberos
- Portable development environment
- Bastion server

Until then!
