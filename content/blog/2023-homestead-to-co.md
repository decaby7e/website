What a journey this was...

Heavily inspired by the likes of [Jeff DePree](http://www.jeffdepree.com/) and
his epic adventures, I knew that I wanted to go on a big road trip this summer.
Luck have it, my friend and fellow adventurer Henry was working as a whitewater
rafting guide in Colorado this summer! These ideas were swirling around in my
head in April/May and I still had school to get through. Once that was done, I
also realized that having money is nice for, well, living and such. I knew I
couldn't dive into this head first. Not to mention that to get out there in a
car requires living accommodations and a Honda Civic is not the most friendly
car for prospective car campers. Luckily for me, my brother had just had his old
car fixed up and got a new one for himself! Let me introduce you to...

What a car! She had some problems, namely a bad transmission, but nothing that
couldn't be repaired. This comes up in the future...

## Goodbye Home(stead)

My drive begun at the bottom of the bottom of the country, in my home in
Homestead, FL. Just to get out of the state was about a 400mi drive! But a
scenic one, with the drab suburbs fading into green fields of grass and oak
trees draped with Spanish moss. Around mile 360, I arrived at my second home of
Gainesville. Here, I saw friends, savored the beauty of the city, and just as
fast as I came was on my way. I had also dropped off some kittens, Dipper and
Fiona. I miss them to this day!

![Love those kitties](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230725_215450457.MP.jpeg)

![Goodbye Florida!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_153856047.MP.jpeg)
*Goodbye Florida! :(*

## Ah, Good Ol' Georgia

Georgia is a pretty place to visit, especially past Atlanta. There are some
fantastic hikes and views to see. On this occasion, I was-a simply passing
through. On OAR trips, we see this billboard every time and it always get lols:

![Ooo! I want one](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_154441671.MP.jpeg)
*Ooo, I want one!*

And don't forget gang: **$limes b4 dime$**:

![On gang](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_222139281.jpeg)
*On the gang*

Alright, thanks Georgia! On to the Smokies

## Ah, Now We're Talking Mountains

Finally, getting into Tennessee rewarded me with my first sight of mountains:

![Country roads or something like that?](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_002930676.jpeg)

The picture does not do justice to how beautiful the sunset was on this day.
Like a Chick-Fil-A peach milksh- oops! Wrong state.

I was really hoping to get into Chattanooga earlier so I could climb at their
fantastic climbing gym: High Point. Thankfully, I got there about an hour before
closing!

![High Point on point](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_011743135.jpeg)
*I'd love to come back and give those lead walls a try. I gain that confidence later on this trip!*

And I've never been to the local aquarium, but my sister assures me it is worth a visit.

![Fishes and stuff are in here](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_022034271.jpeg)

After a brief visit in this beautiful city (I'dve liked to have grabbed a beer,
but my sleepiness was already catching up with me), it was onwards to the Foster
Falls campsite. I'd tried to reserve the site earlier that day online, but was
having issues with the site. I'm in CS, I'm not supposed to have tech issues!
There seemed to be plenty of spots open, so I opted to risk it for the biscuit
and just camp there anyways. To my surprise, there were no cash drop-boxes... We
live in a tech dystopia. Truly hell. /s

The morning greeted me with a view I was elated to come back to:

![The Falls of Foster Falls](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_132309610.jpeg)

At this point, I realized that I could have driven all this way and it would
have been worth it. It brought be right back to Fall of last year, where [OAR
did a trip here](https://ufadventure.com/dt3571) and my eyes were opened up just
a little bit more to the light of adventure and the beauty of the outdoors. I
never knew just how much beauty and stunning landscapes there were just in our
backyard of the Southeast! Enough of that, I know you're really here for the
waterfalls :^)

![The water of the falls](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_133406783.jpeg)
*Wow*

![Hey little crawdad buddy](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_135918288.MP.jpeg)

*This was such a relief to see at the end of the OAR hike. I try to stop and smell the roses more often now.*

![The Element in the elements](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_142018592.jpeg)

I didn't feel that just stopping at the falls was all that was in the books for
the day, so I went on a small hike to visit the other small waterfalls. I drove
about 15 minutes north to the north trailhead, got a look at the map, and
decided to wing it and just loop back around to the parking lot at some point.

![First fall. A bit hazy to swim in...](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_152711610.jpeg)

![The bridge](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_153452553.MP.jpeg)
*This was the first bridge we crossed on the OAR trip. This trail goes about 10+mi or so to the big waterfall shown earlier.*

![Cool light effect](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_153521407.jpeg)
*Looks like a picture my friend Richmond would take. Cue dramatic lens flare*

![Falls galore](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_154140411.MP.jpeg)

I met a number of people along the way. One nice older lady asked that I take a
picture of her and her grandchildren next to the river. She asked about what I
was doing, where I was going, why I was wearing Adidas slides on a hike, and
what exactly "Salt Life" was. I contemplated telling her it was the brand of an
infamous biker gang from the south but instead my good side explained its South
Floridian origin. Coming up on the bridge, I encountered a couple that had been
ahead of me for most of the hike. We talked for a bit and the lady mentioned
that doing the full hike from the bridge to the falls was on her bucket list. I
mentioned the OAR trip and that with camping it was very doable. I hope that she
fulfills this dream one day and the facade of the falls is as sweet a victory
for her as it was for me.

Ok, enough of these darn woods! I need some concrete on my feet. The sweaty,
beating sun on my brow. The glistening heat island of a real city: Nashville.
I'd never been before and had no idea what to expect. I noticed weird roads,
reminiscent of Seattle, with its one ways all over the place. It even had its
own Capitol Hill! I found at a coffee shop next to a sickeningly fancy hotel and
worked there for a few hours. Afterwards, I found a nice burger place, Bama
Burger, and chatted for a bit with the workers there. Then I found one of those
electric bike rental things and gave it a spin:

With my fill of Tennessee, I now planned to drive to Missouri and find a
campsite somewhere before or after Kansas City. Which one exactly? "Ah, we'll
figure it out!"

## A Taste of Kentucky and Illinois

These states were meant to be but passing glances on my drive. I'd been going at
a somewhat leisurely pace, taking my time especially in Tennessee. But the smell
of the Colorado mountains was growing stronger and my desire to get out there
stronger with it. After leaving Nashville, I noted the mountains fading
gracefully into hills and the Kentucky landscape establishing itself on the
horizon. Then Illinois appeared just as soon and night with it. "Uh oh, Missouri
is a bit farther than I expected." It was time to find a campsite. I noticed a
sign on the highway pointing to one, so I followed that and did a lil pioneer
manoeuver of not using Google Maps for once. I drove in, found an open parking
spot in the mostly empty campsite area, and paid my dues at a honor-system pay
booth. Finally! Someone understands the camping crowd! Sleeping that night was
horrendous, as the temps hovered in the high 80s all night. Some passing rain
was my saving grace. After the rain begun to patter on the roof and the temp
dropped a couple of degrees, I was lulled to sleep.

The next morning, I meandered around the campsite:

![Coolest looking sign](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_131648800.MP.jpeg)
*One of the coolest looking trail signs I've seen in a while*

And my heart broke when I saw:

![No climbing?!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_131658882.MP.jpeg)
*No climbing?! Blasphemy!! At least I can ride my goat here*

But this lake I'd missed on the way in the night before was quite nice:

![Nice lake](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_140156129.jpeg)

Thanks Illinois, home to the great Alexandra Chertok of OAR!

## Missouri: The Best Breakdown of My Life

As the driving continued, I admired the mild hills that continued on seemingly
forever:

![Nice hills. Still no mountains though :(](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_175126507.jpeg)

The highway had a really cool looking rock that look like it had been cut to
make way for the highway. Why not just go over the hill? I suppose less ups and
downs are better for the cars?

Things were going quite smooth up until this point. Too smooth... God decided
that it was time to spice things up. As had happened numerous times at this
point, I strayed by a foot or so and rode over the rumble strip on the side of
the highway for a moment. I like to keep safe distance between me and the other
drivers and its also unsafe for me to drive with a BAC of <0.15% (just
kidding!). This time, instead of running over a kitten or broken glass, my car
downshifted and the check engine light came on. Oh Elley...

## And The Car Troubles Begin

Welp. It was a good run. Time to come clean about Ol' Elley.

This car had belonged to my brother for about 2-3 years. They specifically
seeked out an Element, as its a great car for outdoor activities and my brother
is a big fan of fishing. It was a decent deal: a 2004 Honda Element for under
$4000 and less than 120K miles. Relatively low for a car its age. And it was
also from the original owner!

Perhaps unsurprisingly, a deal like this doesn't come without its caveats. It
didn't take long for my dad to realize that this thing was leaking more oil than
the Deepwater Horizon spill (...too soon?). On top of that, some lights in the
dash were out, pretty much most of the engine/transmission mounts were bad, the
power steering went out at one point, leaving my brother to have to crank that
thang to get any turning! One by one though, he whacked these moles back into
their holes and the condition of the car was improving quite a lot. One thorn
remained: the transmission.

### A Small Detour To Automatic Transmission Land

It started not too bad. A rough shift, some clunking noises, etc. But it was
manageable. Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse. My dad changed the
transmission fluid; a procedure that could either bring new life to it OR
completely ruin it. The thing about transmissions is that when the fluid hasn't
been changed in a while, these things called clutch packs (which operate on
friction) start to wear out from dirty fluid. However, all that worn off
material and other contaminants mostly stay in the fluid. This makes the fluid
thicker and actually allows the clutch packs to retain some of their function.
However, when you replace that old, thick, gummy fluid (which is very bad for
the rest of the transmission) with new, delicious, pink-lemonade colored fluid
(mmm... sounds delicious), those clutch packs no longer have the friction they
were used to, and a death spiral ensues as the packs now slip and wear off
whatever material happened to be left.

Ok! Now that you are an expert on automatic transmissions (ATs) (if you are one,
please email me. Kinda not joking. auto-transmissions at ranvier dot net), we
come back to my tale of my brothers ownership of Elley. The AT had always had
issues, but around the beginning of 2023, it started to refuse shifting up from
2nd without a considerable amount of time and painful sounds. No amount of stern
talking to and smacking the dashboard convinced it to start working. To add some
oil-icing on the cake, the timing chain cover was beginning to leak absolute
buckets of oil. This is a part of the engine that is difficult to access, and my
dad was remiss to remove the subframe or lift the engine out of the car. These
things are hard to do without a jack lift!

So this car is seemingly on its way out. But alas, she's not dead yet! He took
the car to a local mechanic and was quoted a reasonable price to both rebuild
the transmission and fix the leak on the timing chain cover. After a few weeks
in the shop, she got her medicine and seemed to be running really nicely! Around
this time, I had just sold my old car and my brother acquired a new one. Elley
was up for the taking and take her I did.

### Some Final Touches Before the Journey

Before getting this car, I had just planned on driving my Honda Civic for the
whole drive. She'd done so well for the 4 or so years I had her, with literally
no mechanical issues and the biggest repair being a bad AC compressor and a
leaky power steering pump. Elley, however, was so large! I could easily fit
anything I wanted in there and still have enough space for a sleeping pad. She
was the one for the job.

After the shop work, we weren't quite out of the weeds. I replaced a sway bar
link that'd gone bad, cleaned the throttle body, discovered a massive rust spot
hiding under some plastic paneling, had the tires rotated, and did my own rough
inspection of the engine bay (I will regret not having a professional do this
later; stay tuned!). My dad had confidence in the car and after driving it about
30mi in town, I agreed with him. What good is a fixed car if ya can't drive it?
And what better way to find issues than a trip of this magnitude? (oh god) On
the road with her I go!

## Back to Missouri

This was the first time in the trip that the check engine light had come on.
That transmission shift thing was also odd, but I figured it could have been
from the rumble strip slowing the car down too much. I pulled off to a gas
station and went under the car for an inspection.

Oh the horror when this was the first thing I saw:

![A bad CV axle](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_215759706.jpeg)
*Uh, I don't think that's an OEM feature*

So theres grease all over the place and the CV axle that comes out of the
transmission and drives the wheel has a completely shredded boot on it. That's
that destroyed rubber piece there. I had no idea how long it had been driving
like that, but I'd gander and say the entire drive, which was probably about
1200mi at this point? I discovered a nice little zip tie on the inside that the
mechanic left as a treat for me I'm assuming. The boot was not in this condition
when we took it to the shop, but it was torn, so my best bet is it deteriorated
quickly and just gave out perhaps when I rode over the rumble strip.

This isn't the end of the world, as I could drive on it theoretically for the
rest of the trip. The problem is that boot is intended to cover rotating metal
parts that are under a lot of load and moving at very high speeds. It could go
for 5000 more miles or it could death spiral and strand me in the deserts of New
Mexico. This feeling in my tummy was not acceptable.

## Onward to Blue Springs

Thankfully, this fiasco had happened close to a nice city called Blue Springs,
MO. I had no idea what to expect from the place, but it was about 40 minutes out
from Kansas City (which is actually mostly in Missouri! what?!?!) so thankfully
it wasn't the middle of nowhere. I went into town, found a hotel, and indulged
in a shower and some hot Domino's Pizza. On the way to get the pizza (terrified
the car would explode at any second), I noticed a sign that said "Ibex Climbing
Gym". Whoa! Not only was I not in the middle of nowhere, but this place even had
a climbing gym! This later turns out to be the best detour of my life, all
thanks to the magic of friendship, climbing, and magical forces of the universe
(ok, the last one is dubious; scientists are working on it).

This place was actually a fantastic gym too. It had tons of bouldering and a
great selection of lead, top-rope, and auto-belay climbs.

![the bouldering section](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230730_234900173.jpeg)

![picture of defeat](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230730_234909614.jpeg)
*V4s and V5s were my absolute limit here; it was some tough and fun climbs!*

I was the first one in the gym that day apparently, and I got to talk to the
employee that was manning (`s/manning/girling/g`) the place. She was very nice
and we talked about when we'd started climbing, where I was from, and the styles
of the climbs at the gym. Eventually, some people had started filing in and
around this same time I'd started working on some of the auto-belays. I sat down
on a bench next to a couple guys that were getting set to do some top-rope. They
were super nice and offered to let me climb with them. We got to talking, did
some routes, and went to get lunch at Chipotle. At this point, we'd talked about
my predicament and Alex mentioned some potential campsites I could visit and a
good mechanic in town he'd used before (thanks Dilday Automotive and Marine!).
He and Brian parted and I headed over to Walmart to get some stuff for the car
and tidy things up. After this, Alex called me and offered to let me stay with
him and Brian at their place, about a 5 minute drive from the gym. So first you
OFFER to belay me, take me to lunch, and then offer to let me sleep over?

Sick!!!

I don't usually go home on the first date (joke!), but these guys were my age,
seemed incredibly nice, and the sound of a couch and shower was just too good to
pass up.

I could make an entire post about my 4 days with Alex and Brian. To sum it up:

- We did some more climbing and got scolded for mock leading (boo! lame!)

- Had some awesome food in Independence and saw a cool looking church

- Did my first run in probably 2 years with Alex

- Went to visit Brian during his guitar lesson and met his teacher. This was the
  highlight of my time there. He was incredibly nice and the atmosphere of the
  studio felt like a scene from a movie

- Had several hot showers (ahhh...)

- Got my car fixed quickly because Mr. Dilday sympathized with my being stranded
  status

And some honorable mentions:

![May the dog](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230731_213151411.MP.jpeg)

![Ah good 'ol dead end sidewalk](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230731_160501554.jpeg)

![beautiful track field](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230801_001617998.jpeg)

![more track](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230801_001620093.jpeg)
*Alex was being nice but he easily smoked me*

I was sad when I had to leave this place. Honestly, I thought Tennessee had made
the trip worth it, but if I were to have driven straight to Blue Springs and
crashed my car into a ditch next to the Ibex climbing gym, it all would have
been worth it. Sincere "thanks yous" to Alex and Brian for sharing their time
and home with me and turning a place where I broke down into a place I'll be
coming back to (this time with a working car!!).

## Goodbye Blue Springs

And Kansas was just around the corner. The first couple hours were really nice.
It reminded me of driving through the hills of central Florida, but with less
suburbs and more windmills.

![Windmills](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230802_185444142.jpeg)
*First time I've seen a windmill!*

The next 5 hours were a bit painful. Not the worst though; I continued to widdle
down my "Liked Songs" playlist on Spotify. I'd actually only been listening to
that this entire trip thus far and I think at this point I was about halfway
through it? I though I'd listen to a podcast or something but the music and the
lull of the road were doing really well for me thus far. Lots of time to think
as well.

Finally arriving in Eastern Colorado, I was greeted by more of the same
landscape as Kansas. But this time, it was Colorado (tm) plains! My first gas
stop awarded me with some doggies:

![Truck dogs](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_002645614.MP.jpeg)
*Ahh... I miss May and my own dog Lucy...*

![Plains of Colorado](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_010913393.jpeg)
*The windmills never ceased to amaze me. They move so fast!*

And soon enough, the mountains appeared on the horizon!

![First sight of Colorado mountains](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_015538191.jpeg)
*Ooo, the rain looks so ominous. I think that's Pike's Peak?*

Time to gas up and make the final stretch to Buena Vista!

![Gassing up](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_020538479.jpeg)
*And the clouds continue to plot against me*

But Elley had other plans for me...

I was driving uphill when suddenly the car went from 3000+RPMs to under 2000 and
refused to go any higher than that. The problem with that is that RPM = speed
and this reduced me to maybe 30mph on the uphill? Oh, and the check engine light
came on. This was even more terrifying than the previous incident, as this time
there were tangible effects and not just scary sounds. Thankfully, I had a code
reader this time:

![OBD code 1](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_032632833.jpeg)
*Engine knock sensor fault*

![OBD code 2](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_035334498.jpeg)
*"A" Rocker Arm Actuator System Performance/stuck Off*

These were scary words. Actuator? Knock sensor?!

**Eh. Computer: clear all codes.**

> **ARE YOU SURE?**

**Yeah**.

> **OK; IM JUST A COMPUTER; I JUST FOLLOW ORDERS. CODES RESET.**

Oh computer... When will you learn: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of
evil is that good men do nothing."

Sorry, that got a little deep. Back to the trip.

This was a future me problem. I need to get into town where the mechanics live
and out of these damn mountains, where the drunk drivers and cougars live!

I later learned that the P2646 code was because of a loose sensor cable. I still
get P0325 to this very day, but it will clear itself randomly. I suspect its
also a cable issue.

## ¡Hola, Buena Vista!

I arrived in this quaint town around 2AM, in part due to the mechanical issues
from earlier. It was quite dark, but I could just make out the silhouette of the
mountains around me. Exhausted, I admired them silently; a far cry from the
leaping and hollering I anticipated I would be overcome by.

The next morning...

![Browns Canyon Rafting. Oh, and mountains!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_185719801.jpeg)
*Browns Canyon Rafting. Oh, and mountains!*

And I was elated to be greeted by none other than His Excellency Henry Matthews
Himself! Her Excellency Hildaleigh Serrano was hard at work kneading the best
pretzel loafs this quaint town had ever seen.

So, this hard working man had some time to greet me, but surely he must be
getting back to his affairs...

> Henry: "Want to get some coffee and head to a crag?"

> Me: ...

At that moment, I promptly peed myself from excitement, cleaned myself up, and
hopped in his car. We went to a place called "The Roastery"

![The Roastery](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_TCyeo3KBfGez1IoMbJVxgwcxCDYEJa5Ra3DF=w408-h306-k-no)

and boy did they have some good coffee. The first time we went (which was
followed by a daily visit each day after), I got The Spanish something,
recommendation of his majesty. The next day, I think I got the Dirty Hippie. In
the last few days of my trip, I settled into the drip coffee + breakfast burrito
combo, which got you a decent black coffee with a fantastic and very filling
breakfast burrito for only $8! I felt like this one should have been called the
Dirty Hippie and I certainly felt like one ordering it, not having showered in a
few days at that point.

Henry pointed out the bakery across the street, "Simple Eatery", and mentioned
that that was where Hildaleigh was working. We were coming back there at noon to
pick her up from work. But now, it was time to climb!

I honestly didn't take many pictures while I was out here! I liked being off my
phone for most of the trip but it makes recalling things chronologically
trickier. Therefore, I'm going to split up my story into chapters of the
different things I did here.

## Life in Town

When I wasn't climbing, hiking, or riding with awesome tow truck drivers
(remember those transmission issues I mentioned earlier?), lots of my time was
spent in the beautiful confines of Buena Vista.

> **Did You Know (TM)**: the **official** pronunciation of the town by locals is
> **B-you-nuh** Vista". For once in my life, I felt like I had the upper hand on
> pronouncing Spanish in a crowd!

My place of living was the parking lot of Browns Canyon Rafting (BCR). They were
gracious hosts, and so long as I didn't poke my head up obnoxiously too much or
for too long, I was allowed a parking spot next to Henry's car. My Element was a
perfect camper. I had all my belongings sorted on one side of the car and my
inflatable sleeping pad on the other. My climbing gear and rope, cooking
equipment, backpacking materials, food, etc. was all easily accessible by
opening the side door of the car. The back has a cool tailgate, like a truck,
that I used on many occasions to tie my shoes, brush my teeth, or open on the
cooler nights to get a clear view of the start-filled night sky.

A gym was adjacent to us, just 5 minutes of walking from our cars. Henry and
Hildaleigh had a membership there and we visited a few times to check out their
climbing gym and showers (a luxury! I will never again take for-granted a hot
shower). We practiced some big whippers in there! Henry took the biggest one by
far, soaring at least a good 15-20ft from the top. By the time I left this
place, I had virtually eliminated my fear of falling, both from a stance of
safety emotions (High Point, Chattanooga: you're mine!).

Downtown had a plethora of fantastic restaurants to dine at. We basically went
to a new place every night. One day, me and Hildaleigh checked out a park and
found the cutest little river that fed into a small lake. Families were out with
their kids, fishing rods laid their bait across the icy water in hopes that the
fish would bite even just the warmer surface, and one man was throwing his baby
up in the air as they giggled with glee. Crossing a bridge, we found a music
festival! People were gathered on their blankets and in backs of their campers,
each with its own fingerprint of beads and draperies.

On one occasion, we all agreed to take a very speedy trip to the Arkansas River
access that was near town and take a cold plunge. We hurried over there at a
blazing speed of 15mph (the town speed limit), threw off our clothes in haste,
and dove head first into the frigid rapids! Ok, a bit of hyperbole, but when we
lowered our bodies warily, I found an odd comfort in the cold! By the time I was
submerged, I felt comfortably numb, and exiting gave me a refreshing wave of
warmth. This was a far cry from my other cold water experience I had tried out a
few days prior.

## A Beautiful Lake Hike

I had grand plans of hiking... something! I knew there were plenty of hikes to
do in Colorado, so I figured I would check some out on my way out of town at the
end of my trip or hit a couple with Henry and Hildaleigh. One day, Hildaleigh
had a morning free and Henry had to work that morning, so she recommended a lake
hike they'd been looking at: Ptarmigan Lake. We some coffee and headed to the
hike.

![Oh, what a pretty lake](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/IMG_4874.jpg)

This thing was cold!!!! I don't know if it was like your sea legs where you have
to ease into it, but I was just not having it. Hildaleigh was a monster and
waded out like 20ft into the deeper parts. "Its not bad" my ass... Apparently
the river was colder to her, so maybe I just got better at handling the cold.
Next time I'm here, I have to do this hike and swim across the entire lake just
to prove to myself that I can!

We collected some superb stream water and started the hike back. It was a
leisurely 2 miles or so and we took our time, admiring the breathtaking nature
surrounding us and talking about life. We got back into town, and later that day
we all climbed together. There was rarely a me and Henry wouldn't!

## The Rock Climbing Crags of The Vista

One of parts of this trip I was the most excited for was the rock climbing. So
Henry had said, there were countless high quality rock climbing crags just a 10
minute drive from our parking lot condos. I was accustomed to driving 5+ hours
to get to just any kind of climbing from Gainesville (10+ from Homestead), so I
was **stoked** to get out there and try as many routes as I could.

I had set a goal for myself to push myself on this trip; both mentally and
physically. I'd done lead climbing before, but was either climbing on stuff that
was practically a ladder or was climbing at my grade but shitting bricks at the
same time. The idea of *potentially* falling in my mind, not to mention the
safety aspect of it, was just utterly horrifying. I had started to do more
leading indoors and my friend Chris Bowen gave me the biggest whipper I've ever
taken at High Point in Chattanooga, so I was better than where I started. This
trip, I had decided, was going to be a turning point. I no longer wanted to
accept my fear getting in the way of some seriously cool climbs.

I didn't keep track of the exact climbs I lead, but it ranged from 5.7 up to
5.10a/b. On the 10a/b, I got past the crux only to realize that my footing was
horrendous. A fall was ensuing and I was hopeless to stop it. I screamed
"falling!" and let gravity take its course. Henry masterfully belayed me and
when I realized my spine was still intact, a wave of euphoria rushed over me. It
was my first unintended fall and a huge step in gaining confidence in leading. I
know it is still a very risky venture, but without some level of confidence, its
even more so.

Henry was a beast on the wall. He dominated slab climbs, walking up them like
they were ladders, and pushed himself hard on the overhung routes. He'd gotten
noticeably better since we'd parted ways at The Knot and I'm sure he's
continuing to improve every day. He knew the area well and took me to some of
his favorite spots. I got to really use my rope and quickdraws for the first
time and it felt good to be climbing outdoors and feeling confident and safe
doing it.

One day, Hildaleigh, Henry, me, and some of the rafting guides from BCR went out
with two ropes and climbed together. I had to leave early to meet with a tow
person that was to pick up Elley (the suspense is building... what happened to
Elley?! Don't worry, we're getting to it =^) ) and when I came back about an
hour later, everyone was still at it! We did some really fun 5.9s and 5.10s and
parted ways when we got back to BCR.

Hildaleigh improved quite a bit on the wall too! Henry had lead a 5.10 and when
Hildaleigh gave it a try, she got just under the last bolt before the anchor.
Later on, she reflected on what she could have done differently and was sure she
could have gotten it. In the gym, she was crushing boulders left and right with
the encouragement of some friendly gym-goers that helped her learn new
strategies, like how to take advantage of her height on some climbs (take that
Henry!).

Climbing in Buena Vista wasn't just icing on the cake; it was the fillet mignon
covered in caviar truffle sauce and topped with edible gold. I hope to climb
many more climbs with Henry, as we built a bedrock of trust and friendship on
the wall, and continue push to harder grades and taller falls.

*A funky start to a 10b alongside an easier 10a; Henry figured this one out but I think I took the dirty cheater start*

</br>*Henry lowering off a route; he had to be back for work in 15 minutes!*

## Mount... *gasp* Elbert... *gasp wheeze*

Finally, a day came where we were all free to do a hike together. What better
one than the tallest one, Mount Elbert? Henry had his reservations, as it was
going to be packed with people due to its popularity, but we all agreed it was a
solid choice and would be worth it despite a potential crowd.

We headed out early in the morning, leaving BCR around 5AM. The drive there was
serene, as we saw the gentle giant Elbert still asleep on the horizon. Arriving
at the parking lot there were already a decent number of people. We organized
ourselves, got our water, and started the approach.

![Element number 2](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_114527353.jpeg)
*Yet another Element! Happy to see some fellow brethren out here*

![Caves rock license plate](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_114541510.MP.jpeg)
*This was a super cool license plate, along with the cool bat speleological sticker*

The approach was very calm, gaining only about 1000ft in elevation over a few
miles. I could already feel myself becoming winded, as the elevation was already
\>10,000ft at just the start of the hike. After passing the tree line, the views
did not disappoint:

![Cant get enough of this](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_134807873.jpeg)

And just as soon, the summit was in view:

![First view of the false summit](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_135938083.jpeg)

Gotcha! This was the first of two false summits. But it would be quite the trek
by itself. It was at this point I was becoming nervous about the effects of
altitude sickness on myself. I have a history of lung issues and was nervous
this might be a bit much for my body. I almost backed out... But realizing what
a disappointment it would be to come so close and just turn around, I decided to
take a calculated risk and continue anyways. I wasn't feeling terrible at this
point and figured I would need to feel a lot worse to warrant aborting.

I told Henry and Hildaleigh to go ahead of me while I rested a bit more. After
an extended break and thorough admiration of the panoramic paradise of mountains
around me, I continued up the path. I talked to many people along the way, with
one group being from someplace in the Southeast. They were all practicing
physicians and had come to Colorado to try their hands at hiking some of its
highest peaks. As I continued, I noticed a diverse range of people hiking this
peak; one man was with his 10 year old son and another group looked like they'd
decided to come up on a whim, wearing gym shorts and T-shirts. The higher up we
went, the colder and windier it was getting, so I felt bad for them!

![Closer and closer](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_144439056.jpeg)

![Almost there](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_155511991.jpeg)
*Getting closer to the first false peak; I still didn't know at this point!*

After a total of about 3 miles of hiking and an elevation gain of 4000ft or so,
we'd finally made it!

![Victory!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_170509882.jpeg)
*Victory!*

![Henbobo and Hil](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_162526791.jpeg)
*You guys **rock**... ok, I'll try to stop the rock jokes*

It was freaking **cold** up here. My thermostat was reading high 40s to low 50s
and the wind was blowing nonstop. We found a nice rock shelter that seemingly
was constructed to help weary hikers like myself hide from the wind. After
calling our parents to share the achievement (the reception up here was
fantastic!), eating some snacks, and taking in as much of the view as we could,
we begun our descent.

![Yes!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230807_170503395.jpeg)

We descended at a much faster pace than the way up, taking long breaks to rest
and appreciate our surroundings. After we got back to the parking lot, we headed
into the closest town, destroyed entire pizzas, and made our way back to Buena
Vista.

*Elbert was now awake and fully stretched out on the horizon as we parted ways*

## Whitewater Rafting!

One thing we had yet to do since I'd arrived was what Henry had mastered in many
months out here: whitewater rafting. I'd dabbled in an easy one in Washington
last summer, but nothing like what Henry was doing out here. One day, he made
room in his schedule to take a few of us out on the river to try out an easier
class 3. The plan was to shuttle a car to the take out point of the river and
then take everyone in my car to the starting point with the raft strapped on the
top of Elley. We made it to the take out point and while driving uphill to
leave, disaster struck.

Elley was dead.

To sum it up, I lost all power going uphill. I get out of the car to see a red
puddle of fluid accumulating under the car and a horrible smell of something
burning. I quickly learned that this was transmission fluid and this car was
going nowhere but downhill. We had some kind bystanders help us push the car
around and we then neutraled downhill back to the parking lot. This was a
disaster.

I called AAA, we all drove back to BCR, and later at night I was driven back to
meet with a tow truck driver. On the drive back to the BCR, I talked with him
about where he was from and how he ended up in Colorado. It turns out, he'd been
a very wealthy investment banker in Atlanta in his past life! He detailed his
amazing adventure and his dreams of motorcycling across all of Russia with his
friends to me. When we got back, I said farewell and wished him luck on his
future journeys.

The next day, I took a look inside the car and detected the source of the
problem: a cooling hose had come loose from the transmission and ejected all of
the fluid from it. The burning smell was coming from fluid that had found its
way onto the engine and was burning. Possibly also coming from inside the
transmission. The most... annoying, lets call it, detail I noticed was the
positioning of a clamp on the hose. It was about 3 inches away from the end of
the hose, very far away from where it was supposed to be. This was certainly the
cause of the slippage and the result of human error. I'd been so worried about
Elley this entire trip, thinking the transmission would fall out of the car or
the engine would start knocking or smoke would start billowing from every crack
and crevice. But her final blow was the result of human incompetency.

Oh poor Elley...

## Mayday Mayday! We're Going Up!

Due to the terms of the warranty we had on the car, towing it back home was the
only option I had. This piled more salt to the wound, but needing to be back
before the end of the week anyways, it was my only option.

![Goodbye Elley](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230810_200354447.jpeg)
*Goodbye Elley! Get home safe.*

I was fortunate enough to find a fairly cheap flight from Colorado Springs
directly to Gainesville. Henry and Hildaleigh were leaving Buena Vista around
this time too, so the timing was just right for them to drop me off at the
airport as they started their long drive home. The drive to Colorado Springs was
perhaps the most scenic one yet. I'd done the same one on the way to Buena Vista
but I was significantly more stressed and it was way darker out. Me and Henry
speculated on the climbability of some awesome looking rock formations that
appeared at the bend of every corner. Vast plains carpeted the landscape as we
left the collegiate peaks and as we got closer and closer to the Springs, Pikes
Peak dominated the horizon:

![I think thats Pikes??](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230811_173426369.jpeg)

Arriving at the airport, we made our final farewells. I had an absolutely
fantastic time with Henry and Hildaleigh in Colorado and feel like I got to know
them so much better than I ever had. Climbing, hiking, eating, and facing
various trials and tribulations together, it was the highlight of my entire
summer and a moment of my life I will never forget. I hope to continue climbing
with Henry for as long as I can and hope that Hildaleigh may be there with us to
share in the glory and triumph.

![Goodbye Colorado!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230811_211014091.jpeg)
*Goodbye Colorado! I'm going to miss you dearly.*

Arriving in Dallas for my connecting flight, I chuckled at the lack of IT
prowess in display:

![Lol](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230811_231303331.jpeg)

And after a short 6 hours, I was back at home in Gainesville.

## Home Sweet Home

The day after I arrived was my Pop Pop's 90th birthday. I was so happy to see
him again after so long apart along with the rest of my family. We had a
fantastic breakfast and sitting at the table, I felt a deeper appreciation for
what I was so gifted to have. Though my journey was long and exciting, this was
what it was all about. I learned through this trip that I would trade a lifetime
of adventure for my family and friends if it came down to it.
