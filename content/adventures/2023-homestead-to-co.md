What a journey this was...

Heavily inspired by the likes of [Jeff DePree](http://www.jeffdepree.com/) and
his epic adventures, I knew that I wanted to go on a big road trip this summer.
Luck have it, my friend and fellow adventurer Henry was working as a whitewater
rafting guide in Colorado this summer! These ideas were swirling around in my
head in April/May and I still had school to get through. Once that was done, I
also realized that having money is nice for, well, living and such. I knew I
couldn't dive into this head first. Not to mention that to get out there in a
car requires living accommodations and a Honda Civic is not the most friendly
car for prospective car campers. Luckily for me, my brother had just had his old
car fixed up and got a new one for himself! Let me introduce you to...

What a car! She had some problems, namely a bad transmission, but nothing that
couldn't be repaired. This comes up in the future...

## Goodbye Home(stead)

My drive begun at the bottom of the bottom of the country, in my home in
Homestead, FL. Just to get out of the state was about a 400mi drive! But a
scenic one, with the drab suburbs fading into green fields of grass and oak
trees draped with Spanish moss. Around mile 360, I arrived at my second home of
Gainesville. Here, I visited my girlfriend, saw friends, savored the beauty of
the city, and was on my way. I had also dropped off some kittens, Dipper and
Fiona. I miss them to this day!

*Goodbye Florida! :(*

## Ah, Good Ol' Georgia

Georgia is a pretty place to visit, especially past Atlanta. There are some
fantastic hikes and views to see. On this occasion, I was-a simply passing
through. On OAR trips, we see this billboard every time and it always get lols:

![Ooo! I want one](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_154441671.MP.jpeg)
*Ooo, I want one!*

And don't forget gang: **$limes b4 dime$**:

Alright, thanks Georgia! On to the Smokies

## Ah, Now We're Talking Mountains

Finally, getting into Tennessee rewarded me with my first sight of mountains:

![Country roads or something like that?](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_002930676.jpeg)

The picture does not do justice to how beautiful the sunset was on this day.
Like a Chick-Fil-A peach milksh- oops! Wrong state.

I was really hoping to get into Chattanooga earlier so I could climb at their
fantastic climbing gym: High Point. Thankfully, I got there about an hour before closing!

![High Point on point](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_011743135.jpeg)
*I'd love to come back and give those lead walls a try. I gain that confidence later on this trip!*

And I've never been to the local aquarium, but my sister assures me it is worth a visit.

After a brief visit in this beautiful city (I'dve liked to have grabbed a beer,
but my sleepiness was already catching up with me), it was onwards to the Foster
Falls campsite. I'd tried to reserve the site earlier that day online, but was
having issues with the site. I'm in CS, I'm not supposed to have tech issues!
There seemed to be plenty of spots open, so I opted to risk it for the biscuit
and just camp there anyways. To my surprise, there were no cash drop-boxes... We
live in a tech dystopia. Truly hell. /s

The morning greeted me with a view I was elated to come back to:

![The Falls of Foster Falls](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_132309610.jpeg)

At this point, I realized that I could have driven all this way and it would
have been worth it. It brought be right back to Fall of last year, where [OAR
did a trip here](https://ufadventure.com/dt3571) and my eyes were opened up just
a little bit more to the light of adventure and the beauty of the outdoors. I
never knew just how much beauty and stunning landscapes there were just in our
backyard of the Southeast! Enough of that, I know you're really here for the
waterfalls :^)

![The water of the falls](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_133406783.jpeg)
*Wow*

*This was such a relief to see at the end of the OAR hike. I try to stop and smell the roses more often now.*

I didn't feel that just stopping at the falls was all that was in the books for
the day, so I went on a small hike to visit the other small waterfalls. I drove
about 15 minutes north to the north trailhead, got a look at the map, and
decided to wing it and just loop back around to the parking lot at some point.

![First fall. A bit hazy to swim in...](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_152711610.jpeg)

![The bridge](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_153452553.MP.jpeg)
*This was the first bridge we crossed on the OAR trip. This trail goes about 10+mi or so to the big waterfall shown earlier.*

*Looks like a picture my friend Richmond would take. Cue dramatic lens flare*

![Falls galore](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_154140411.MP.jpeg)

I met a number of people along the way. One nice older lady asked that I take a
picture of her and her grandchildren next to the river. She asked about what I
was doing, where I was going, why I was wearing Adidas slides on a hike, and
what exactly "Salt Life" was. I contemplated telling her it was the brand of an
infamous biker gang from the south but instead my good side explained its South
Floridian origin. Coming up on the bridge, I encountered a couple that had been
ahead of me for most of the hike. We talked for a bit and the lady mentioned
that doing the full hike from the bridge to the falls was on her bucket list. I
mentioned the OAR trip and that with camping it was very doable. I hope that she
fulfills this dream one day and the facade of the falls is as sweet a victory
for her as it was for me.

Ok, enough of these darn woods! I need some concrete on my feet. The sweaty,
beating sun on my brow. The glistening heat island of a real city: Nashville.
I'd never been before and had no idea what to expect. I noticed weird roads,
reminiscent of Seattle, with its one ways all over the place. It even had its
own Capitol Hill! I found at a coffee shop next to a sickeningly fancy hotel and
worked there for a few hours. Afterwards, I found a nice burger place, Bama
Burger, and chatted for a bit with the workers there. Then I found one of those
electric bike rental things and gave it a spin:

With my fill of Tennessee, I now planned to drive to Missouri and find a
campsite somewhere before or after Kansas City. Which one exactly? "Ah, we'll
figure it out!"

## A Taste of Kentucky and Illinois

These states were meant to be but passing glances on my drive. I'd been going at
a somewhat leisurely pace, taking my time especially in Tennessee. But the smell
of the Colorado mountains was growing stronger and my desire to get out there
stronger with it. After leaving Nashville, I noted the mountains fading
gracefully into hills and the Kentucky landscape establishing itself on the
horizon. Then Illinois appeared just as soon and night with it. "Uh oh, Missouri
is a bit farther than I expected." It was time to find a campsite. I noticed a
sign on the highway pointing to one, so I followed that and did a lil pioneer
manoeuver of not using Google Maps for once. I drove in, found an open parking
spot in the mostly empty campsite area, and paid my dues at a honor-system pay
booth. Finally! Someone understands the camping crowd! Sleeping that night was
horrendous, as the temps hovered in the high 80s all night. Some passing rain
was my saving grace. After the rain begun to patter on the roof and the temp
dropped a couple of degrees, I was lulled to sleep.

The next morning, I meandered around the campsite:

*One of the cooler looking trail signs I've seen in a while*

And my heart broke when I saw:

![No climbing?!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_131658882.MP.jpeg)
*No climbing?! Blasphemy!!*

But this lake I'd missed on the way in the night before was quite nice:

Thanks Illinois, home to the great Alexandra Chertok of OAR!

## Missouri: The Best Breakdown of My Life

As the driving continued, I admired the mild hills that continued on seemingly forever:

![Nice hills. Still no mountains though :(](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_175126507.jpeg)
