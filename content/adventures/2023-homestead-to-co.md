What a journey this was...

Heavily inspired by the likes of [Jeff DePree](http://www.jeffdepree.com/) and
his epic adventures, I knew that I wanted to go on a big road trip this summer.
Luck have it, my friend and fellow adventurer Henry was working as a whitewater
rafting guide in Colorado this summer! These ideas were swirling around in my
head in April/May and I still had school to get through. Once that was done, I
also realized that having money is nice for, well, living and such. I knew I
couldn't dive into this head first. Not to mention that to get out there in a
car requires living accommodations and a Honda Civic is not the most friendly
car for prospective car campers. Luckily for me, my brother had just had his old
car fixed up and got a new one for himself! Let me introduce you to...

What a car! She had some problems, namely a bad transmission, but nothing that
couldn't be repaired. This comes up in the future...

## Goodbye Home(stead)

My drive begun at the bottom of the bottom of the country, in my home in
Homestead, FL. Just to get out of the state was about a 400mi drive! But a
scenic one, with the drab suburbs fading into green fields of grass and oak
trees draped with Spanish moss. Around mile 360, I arrived at my second home of
Gainesville. Here, I visited my girlfriend, saw friends, savored the beauty of
the city, and was on my way. I had also dropped off some kittens, Dipper and
Fiona. I miss them to this day!

![Love those kitties](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230725_215450457.MP.jpeg)

![Goodbye Florida!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_153856047.MP.jpeg)
*Goodbye Florida! :(*

## Ah, Good Ol' Georgia

Georgia is a pretty place to visit, especially past Atlanta. There are some
fantastic hikes and views to see. On this occasion, I was-a simply passing
through. On OAR trips, we see this billboard every time and it always get lols:

![Ooo! I want one](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_154441671.MP.jpeg)
*Ooo, I want one!*

And don't forget gang: **$limes b4 dime$**:

![On gang](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230727_222139281.jpeg)
*On the gang*

Alright, thanks Georgia! On to the Smokies

## Ah, Now We're Talking Mountains

Finally, getting into Tennessee rewarded me with my first sight of mountains:

![Country roads or something like that?](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_002930676.jpeg)

The picture does not do justice to how beautiful the sunset was on this day.
Like a Chick-Fil-A peach milksh- oops! Wrong state.

I was really hoping to get into Chattanooga earlier so I could climb at their
fantastic climbing gym: High Point. Thankfully, I got there about an hour before
closing!

![High Point on point](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_011743135.jpeg)
*I'd love to come back and give those lead walls a try. I gain that confidence later on this trip!*

And I've never been to the local aquarium, but my sister assures me it is worth a visit.

![Fishes and stuff are in here](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_022034271.jpeg)

After a brief visit in this beautiful city (I'dve liked to have grabbed a beer,
but my sleepiness was already catching up with me), it was onwards to the Foster
Falls campsite. I'd tried to reserve the site earlier that day online, but was
having issues with the site. I'm in CS, I'm not supposed to have tech issues!
There seemed to be plenty of spots open, so I opted to risk it for the biscuit
and just camp there anyways. To my surprise, there were no cash drop-boxes... We
live in a tech dystopia. Truly hell. /s

The morning greeted me with a view I was elated to come back to:

![The Falls of Foster Falls](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_132309610.jpeg)

At this point, I realized that I could have driven all this way and it would
have been worth it. It brought be right back to Fall of last year, where [OAR
did a trip here](https://ufadventure.com/dt3571) and my eyes were opened up just
a little bit more to the light of adventure and the beauty of the outdoors. I
never knew just how much beauty and stunning landscapes there were just in our
backyard of the Southeast! Enough of that, I know you're really here for the
waterfalls :^)

![The water of the falls](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_133406783.jpeg)
*Wow*

![Hey little crawdad buddy](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_135918288.MP.jpeg)

*This was such a relief to see at the end of the OAR hike. I try to stop and smell the roses more often now.*

![The Element in the elements](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_142018592.jpeg)

I didn't feel that just stopping at the falls was all that was in the books for
the day, so I went on a small hike to visit the other small waterfalls. I drove
about 15 minutes north to the north trailhead, got a look at the map, and
decided to wing it and just loop back around to the parking lot at some point.

![First fall. A bit hazy to swim in...](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_152711610.jpeg)

![The bridge](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_153452553.MP.jpeg)
*This was the first bridge we crossed on the OAR trip. This trail goes about 10+mi or so to the big waterfall shown earlier.*

![Cool light effect](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_153521407.jpeg)
*Looks like a picture my friend Richmond would take. Cue dramatic lens flare*

![Falls galore](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230728_154140411.MP.jpeg)

I met a number of people along the way. One nice older lady asked that I take a
picture of her and her grandchildren next to the river. She asked about what I
was doing, where I was going, why I was wearing Adidas slides on a hike, and
what exactly "Salt Life" was. I contemplated telling her it was the brand of an
infamous biker gang from the south but instead my good side explained its South
Floridian origin. Coming up on the bridge, I encountered a couple that had been
ahead of me for most of the hike. We talked for a bit and the lady mentioned
that doing the full hike from the bridge to the falls was on her bucket list. I
mentioned the OAR trip and that with camping it was very doable. I hope that she
fulfills this dream one day and the facade of the falls is as sweet a victory
for her as it was for me.

Ok, enough of these darn woods! I need some concrete on my feet. The sweaty,
beating sun on my brow. The glistening heat island of a real city: Nashville.
I'd never been before and had no idea what to expect. I noticed weird roads,
reminiscent of Seattle, with its one ways all over the place. It even had its
own Capitol Hill! I found at a coffee shop next to a sickeningly fancy hotel and
worked there for a few hours. Afterwards, I found a nice burger place, Bama
Burger, and chatted for a bit with the workers there. Then I found one of those
electric bike rental things and gave it a spin:

With my fill of Tennessee, I now planned to drive to Missouri and find a
campsite somewhere before or after Kansas City. Which one exactly? "Ah, we'll
figure it out!"

## A Taste of Kentucky and Illinois

These states were meant to be but passing glances on my drive. I'd been going at
a somewhat leisurely pace, taking my time especially in Tennessee. But the smell
of the Colorado mountains was growing stronger and my desire to get out there
stronger with it. After leaving Nashville, I noted the mountains fading
gracefully into hills and the Kentucky landscape establishing itself on the
horizon. Then Illinois appeared just as soon and night with it. "Uh oh, Missouri
is a bit farther than I expected." It was time to find a campsite. I noticed a
sign on the highway pointing to one, so I followed that and did a lil pioneer
manoeuver of not using Google Maps for once. I drove in, found an open parking
spot in the mostly empty campsite area, and paid my dues at a honor-system pay
booth. Finally! Someone understands the camping crowd! Sleeping that night was
horrendous, as the temps hovered in the high 80s all night. Some passing rain
was my saving grace. After the rain begun to patter on the roof and the temp
dropped a couple of degrees, I was lulled to sleep.

The next morning, I meandered around the campsite:

![Coolest looking sign](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_131648800.MP.jpeg)
*One of the coolest looking trail signs I've seen in a while*

And my heart broke when I saw:

![No climbing?!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_131658882.MP.jpeg)
*No climbing?! Blasphemy!! At least I can ride my goat here*

But this lake I'd missed on the way in the night before was quite nice:

![Nice lake](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_140156129.jpeg)

Thanks Illinois, home to the great Alexandra Chertok of OAR!

## Missouri: The Best Breakdown of My Life

As the driving continued, I admired the mild hills that continued on seemingly
forever:

![Nice hills. Still no mountains though :(](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_175126507.jpeg)

The highway had a really cool looking rock that look like it had been cut to
make way for the highway. Why not just go over the hill? I suppose less ups and
downs are better for the cars?

Things were going quite smooth up until this point. Too smooth... God decided
that it was time to spice things up. As had happened numerous times at this
point, I strayed by a foot or so and rode over the rumble strip on the side of
the highway for a moment. I like to keep safe distance between me and the other
drivers and its also unsafe for me to drive with a BAC of <0.15% (just
kidding!). This time, instead of running over a kitten or broken glass, my car
downshifted and the check engine light came on. Oh Elley...

## And The Car Troubles Begin

Welp. It was a good run. Time to come clean about Ol' Elley.

This car had belonged to my brother for about 2-3 years. They specifically
seeked out an Element, as its a great car for outdoor activities and my brother
is a big fan of fishing. It was a decent deal: a 2004 Honda Element for under
$4000 and less than 120K miles. Relatively low for a car its age. And it was
also from the original owner!

Perhaps unsurprisingly, a deal like this doesn't come without its caveats. It
didn't take long for my dad to realize that this thing was leaking more oil than
the Deepwater Horizon spill (...too soon?). On top of that, some lights in the
dash were out, pretty much most of the engine/transmission mounts were bad, the
power steering went out at one point, leaving my brother to have to crank that
thang to get any turning! One by one though, he whacked these moles back into
their holes and the condition of the car was improving quite a lot. One thorn
remained: the transmission.

### A Small Detour To Automatic Transmission Land

It started not too bad. A rough shift, some clunking noises, etc. But it was
manageable. Unfortunately, it just kept getting worse. My dad changed the
transmission fluid; a procedure that could either bring new life to it OR
completely ruin it. The thing about transmissions is that when the fluid hasn't
been changed in a while, these things called clutch packs (which operate on
friction) start to wear out from dirty fluid. However, all that worn off
material and other contaminants mostly stay in the fluid. This makes the fluid
thicker and actually allows the clutch packs to retain some of their function.
However, when you replace that old, thick, gummy fluid (which is very bad for
the rest of the transmission) with new, delicious, pink-lemonade colored fluid
(mmm... sounds delicious), those clutch packs no longer have the friction they
were used to, and a death spiral ensues as the packs now slip and wear off
whatever material happened to be left.

Ok! Now that you are an expert on automatic transmissions (ATs) (if you are one,
please email me. Kinda not joking. auto-transmissions at ranvier dot net), we
come back to my tale of my brothers ownership of Elley. The AT had always had
issues, but around the beginning of 2023, it started to refuse shifting up from
2nd without a considerable amount of time and painful sounds. No amount of stern
talking to and smacking the dashboard convinced it to start working. To add some
oil-icing on the cake, the timing chain cover was beginning to leak absolute
buckets of oil. This is a part of the engine that is difficult to access, and my
dad was remiss to remove the subframe or lift the engine out of the car. These
things are hard to do without a jack lift!

So this car is seemingly on its way out. But alas, she's not dead yet! He took
the car to a local mechanic and was quoted a reasonable price to both rebuild
the transmission and fix the leak on the timing chain cover. After a few weeks
in the shop, she got her medicine and seemed to be running really nicely! Around
this time, I had just sold my old car and my brother acquired a new one. Elley
was up for the taking and take her I did.

### Some Final Touches Before the Journey

Before getting this car, I had just planned on driving my Honda Civic for the
whole drive. She'd done so well for the 4 or so years I had her, with literally
no mechanical issues and the biggest repair being a bad AC compressor and a
leaky power steering pump. Elley, however, was so large! I could easily fit
anything I wanted in there and still have enough space for a sleeping pad. She
was the one for the job.

After the shop work, we weren't quite out of the weeds. I replaced a sway bar
link that'd gone bad, cleaned the throttle body, discovered a massive rust spot
hiding under some plastic paneling, had the tires rotated, and did my own rough
inspection of the engine bay (I will regret not having a professional do this
later; stay tuned!). My dad had confidence in the car and after driving it about
30mi in town, I agreed with him. What good is a fixed car if ya can't drive it?
And what better way to find issues than a trip of this magnitude? (oh god) On
the road with her I go!

## Back to Missouri

This was the first time in the trip that the check engine light had come on.
That transmission shift thing was also odd, but I figured it could have been
from the rumble strip slowing the car down too much. I pulled off to a gas
station and went under the car for an inspection.

Oh the horror when this was the first thing I saw:

![A bad CV axle](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230729_215759706.jpeg)
*Uh, I don't think that's an OEM feature*

So theres grease all over the place and the CV axle that comes out of the
transmission and drives the wheel has a completely shredded boot on it. That's
that destroyed rubber piece there. I had no idea how long it had been driving
like that, but I'd gander and say the entire drive, which was probably about
1200mi at this point? I discovered a nice little zip tie on the inside that the
mechanic left as a treat for me I'm assuming. The boot was not in this condition
when we took it to the shop, but it was torn, so my best bet is it deteriorated
quickly and just gave out perhaps when I rode over the rumble strip.

This isn't the end of the world, as I could drive on it theoretically for the
rest of the trip. The problem is that boot is intended to cover rotating metal
parts that are under a lot of load and moving at very high speeds. It could go
for 5000 more miles or it could death spiral and strand me in the deserts of New
Mexico. This feeling in my tummy was not acceptable.

## Onward to Blue Springs

Thankfully, this fiasco had happened close to a nice city called Blue Springs,
MO. I had no idea what to expect from the place, but it was about 40 minutes out
from Kansas City (which is actually mostly in Missouri! what?!?!) so thankfully
it wasn't the middle of nowhere. I went into town, found a hotel, and indulged
in a shower and some hot Domino's Pizza. On the way to get the pizza (terrified
the car would explode at any second), I noticed a sign that said "Ibex Climbing
Gym". Whoa! Not only was I not in the middle of nowhere, but this place even had
a climbing gym! This later turns out to be the best detour of my life, all
thanks to the magic of friendship, climbing, and magical forces of the universe
(ok, the last one is dubious; scientists are working on it).

This place was actually a fantastic gym too. It had tons of bouldering and a
great selection of lead, top-rope, and auto-belay climbs.

![the bouldering section](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230730_234900173.jpeg)

![picture of defeat](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230730_234909614.jpeg)
*V4s and V5s were my absolute limit here; it was some tough and fun climbs!*

I was the first one in the gym that day apparently, and I got to talk to the
employee that was manning (`s/manning/girling/g`) the place. She was very nice
and we talked about when we'd started climbing, where I was from, and the styles
of the climbs at the gym. Eventually, some people had started filing in and
around this same time I'd started working on some of the auto-belays. I sat down
on a bench next to a couple guys that were getting set to do some top-rope. They
were super nice and offered to let me climb with them. We got to talking, did
some routes, and went to get lunch at Chipotle. At this point, we'd talked about
my predicament and Alex mentioned some potential campsites I could visit and a
good mechanic in town he'd used before (thanks Dilday Automotive and Marine!).
He and Brian parted and I headed over to Walmart to get some stuff for the car
and tidy things up. After this, Alex called me and offered to let me stay with
him and Brian at their place, about a 5 minute drive from the gym. So first you
OFFER to belay me, take me to lunch, and then offer to let me sleep over?

Sick!!!

I don't usually go home on the first date (joke!), but these guys were my age,
seemed incredibly nice, and the sound of a couch and shower was just too good to
pass up.

I could make an entire post about my 4 days with Alex and Brian. To sum it up:

- We did some more climbing and got scolded for mock leading (boo! lame!)

- Had some awesome food in Independence and saw a cool looking church

- Did my first run in probably 2 years with Alex

- Went to visit Brian during his guitar lesson and met his teacher. This was the
  highlight of my time there. He was incredibly nice and the atmosphere of the
  studio felt like a scene from a movie

- Had several hot showers (ahhh...)

- Got my car fixed quickly because Mr. Dilday sympathized with my being stranded
  status

And some honorable mentions:

![Ah good 'ol dead end sidewalk](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230731_160501554.jpeg)

*Alex was being nice but he easily smoked me*

I was sad when I had to leave this place. Honestly, I thought Tennessee had made
the trip worth it, but if I were to have driven straight to Blue Springs and
crashed my car into a ditch next to the Ibex climbing gym, it all would have
been worth it. Sincere "thanks yous" to Alex and Brian for sharing their time
and home with me and turning a place where I broke down into a place I'll be
coming back to (this time with a working car!!).

## Goodbye Blue Springs

And Kansas was just around the corner. The first couple hours were really nice.
It reminded me of driving through the hills of central Florida, but with less
suburbs and more windmills.

![Windmills](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230802_185444142.jpeg)
*First time I've seen a windmill!*

The next 5 hours were a bit painful. Not the worst though; I continued to widdle
down my "Liked Songs" playlist on Spotify. I'd actually only been listening to
that this entire trip thus far and I think at this point I was about halfway
through it? I though I'd listen to a podcast or something but the music and the
lull of the road were doing really well for me thus far. Lots of time to think
as well.

Finally arriving in Eastern Colorado, I was greeted by more of the same
landscape as Kansas. But this time, it was Colorado (tm) plains! My first gas
stop awarded me with some doggies:

![Truck dogs](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_002645614.MP.jpeg)
*Ahh... I miss May and my own dog Lucy...*

![Plains of Colorado](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_010913393.jpeg)
*The windmills never ceased to amaze me. They move so fast!*

And soon enough, the mountains appeared on the horizon!

![First sight of Colorado mountains](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_015538191.jpeg)
*Ooo, the rain looks so ominous. I think that's Pike's Peak?*

Time to gas up and make the final stretch to Buena Vista!

![Gassing up](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_020538479.jpeg)
*And the clouds continue to plot against me*

But Elley had other plans for me...

I was driving uphill when suddenly the car went from 3000+RPMs to under 2000 and
refused to go any higher than that. The problem with that is that RPM = speed
and this reduced me to maybe 30mph on the uphill? Oh, and the check engine light
came on. This was even more terrifying than the previous incident, as this time
there were tangible effects and not just scary sounds. Thankfully, I had a code
reader this time:

![OBD code 1](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_032632833.jpeg)
*Engine knock sensor fault*

![OBD code 2](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_035334498.jpeg)
*"A" Rocker Arm Actuator System Performance/stuck Off*

These were scary words. Actuator? Knock sensor?!

**Eh. Computer: clear all codes.**

> **ARE YOU SURE?**

**Yeah**.

> **OK; IM JUST A COMPUTER; I JUST FOLLOW ORDERS. CODES RESET.**

Oh computer... When will you learn: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of
evil is that good men do nothing."

Sorry, that got a little deep. Back to the trip.

This was a future me problem. I need to get into town where the mechanics live
and out of these damn mountains, where the drunk drivers and cougars live!

I later learned that the P2646 code was because of a loose sensor cable. I still
get P0325 to this very day, but it will clear itself randomly. I suspect its
also a cable issue.

## ¡Hola, Buena Vista!

I arrived in this quaint town around 2AM, in part due to the mechanical issues
from earlier. It was quite dark, but I could just make out the silhouette of the
mountains around me. Exhausted, I admired them silently; a far cry from the
leaping and hollering I had anticipated I would be overcome by.

The next morning...

![Browns Canyon Rafting. Oh, and mountains!](https://public.ranvier.net/images/trip-2023-homestead-to-co/PXL_20230803_185719801.jpeg)
