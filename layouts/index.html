          Welcome to Ranvier! A combination of my personal blog, project repository, contact and resume page, and scratchpad of various notes and information.
          I'll also be playing around with different web-dev excersizes on here so don't be alarmed if something has gone <i>arigh</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Jack Polk (aka decaby7e) and I currently work at UF's College of Computer Science helping to make things and improve existing infrastructure.
          My main focus as of now is DevOps and web development, but most of the time I'm a full time student.
        </p>
